# JavaScript-Game: Conception Time! 

Github ID: atrixatr

Game Description:

While a random couple is “wrestling” under the sheets, you suddenly find yourself in a place you’ve never seen before…

You are a lone sperm cell, and you have one objective: 
Get to the egg and have a chance of living life.

Unfortunately, there are obstacles blocking your way, becoming tighter the farther you travel. But with your tail, you have the ability to swim and maneuver past these annoying obstacles. If you manage to get past all 20 obstacles, you’ll reach the egg and win!

Controls:
Tap your left mouse button to make your sperm swim upwards in a ‘bouncy’ like motion. That’s it.

Rules: 
-Swim your way to the egg while avoiding obstacles!
-You can’t touch the pillars of flesh, nor the ground, or else you die.
-The pillars will slowly close tighter as time goes on, making the game slightly harder the longer you live.
-You need to get past 20 of these pillars before you reach the egg.
-When you reach the egg, you win!
